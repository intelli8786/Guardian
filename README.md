This repository contains the official implementation of the following paper:
> **Implementation of Windows OS PC Security System using USB Storage Device and Smartphone**<br>
> In this paper, we propose a security solution for user PC authentication using a USB storage device and a smartphone. Our method is to use a USB storage device and a smartphone as a semi-physical security key to control the availability of the PC. We used KISA SEED as the algorithm to encrypt the key, and the encrypted key is recorded on USB storage or smartphone and used for authentication. Especially in the case of smartphones, the availability of the PC can be adjusted according to the user's location or intention by using a heartbeat signal or udp packet using wireless communication. Our solution will provide fast and intuitive security to users by providing semi-physical security devices.
